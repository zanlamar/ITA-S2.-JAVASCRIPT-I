# ITA SPRINT 2: JAVASCRIPT Basics — by Ana Laf

## 📄 Description
Second sprint of the bootcamp. First part focused on JavaScript Basics.




## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and practice the use of **arrow functions**.
- Learn and apply the **ternary operator** in different contexts.
- Understand and work with **callbacks**.
- Get to know and use the **Rest and Spread operators**.
- Become familiar with **loops and array transformations**.
- Start working with **promises** and **asynchronous functions with await**



## 💻 Technologies Used

HTML · CSS · JavaScript



## 📋 Requisitos

No additional dependencies are required to run this project. You just need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).



## 🛠 Installation

There’s no need to install anything for this project, just clone the Git repository and dive through the main.html file.




## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into **7 folders**, each focusing on a different JavaScript concept.

Every folder contains:
- A `.js` file with the JavaScript code.
- An `.html` file to visualize the exercises.

Each HTML file clearly separates the **three levels of difficulty** for the exercises: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

## 📋 Takeaways
- Easier to learn from a coding language you already have a basic knowledge of.
- Kind of super obvious, but some minimal well-thought CSS can transform visually the html experience.




## 💬 Notes
- Slowly applying good practices: commits and code in English without comments.
- Some extra care and professionalism into the readme.
- Working with bash terminal rather than PowerShell.




### ⭐ Highlights

- Thanks to Antonio for its detailed check.
- Happily surprised to feel I missed JavaScript (for now hehe).
